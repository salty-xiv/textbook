# I1. Limit Cut

Limit Cut Toolbox: [Link](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=240411819443951&preview=1)

## Explanation of Mechanics

Cruise Chaser will mark all players with a number from 1-8 for his Numbers mechanic from A11S. Odds will be üîµ blue, evens will be üî¥ red.

Each slash / dash gives a vuln debuff (you can't get hit more than once).

{: .important }

> Odds: Cruise Chaser will teleport behind you and slash you with a wide cleave that deals a minor knockback (can be mitigated).

{: .warning }

> Evens: Cruise Chaser will dash towards you in a line AOE. If you are not looking directly at Cruise Chaser, you will be knocked back very far (can be mitigated).

The slash/dash pattern happens in sequential order (e.g. Slash 1 then dash to 2; Slash 3 then dash to 4, etc).

While this is happening, Hawk Blaster AOEs will explode in pairs around the stage, rotating clockwise. They can start in any cardinal/intercardinal, but they will always be opposite of each other. After 4 sets of Hawk Blaster explosions, the 5th one will be in the center.
The cycle will repeat again for the 6th-9th explosions rotating CW, and the 10th explosion being in the center.

The Hawk Blaster AOEs have very early snapshots - you can "walk into" the explosions if you understand the timing.

## Resolution - 1256 Split

To get as much practice in as possible, we're going to be using Aether PF strats. The Limit Cut strat currently used is the 1256 W-NE split.

The party will split into two separate groups based on their numbers: 1256 / 3478.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 5Ô∏è‚É£ 6Ô∏è‚É£ follows the first explosion occurring between West and Northeast.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ 4Ô∏è‚É£ 7Ô∏è‚É£ 8Ô∏è‚É£ follows the first explosion occurring between East and Southwest (or, just go opposite of 1256 group).

People determine this split in different ways. Some use their camera pointed in a certain direction. Up to you how you do it, as long as it works. :3

Refer to the diagram below to determine the group splits based on the first explosion:

![first explosion Example Image](/assets/images/tea/sip-i1-01.png)

12 and 34 will be running along the "inner ring", while 56 and 78 will be running along the "outer ring".

The odd will be followed by their next even (e.g. 1 will be in front of 2) and the odd will bait their cleave forward.

The even will stand roughly 2 - 3 floor lights behind the odd player and bait their dash. (Do not stand at an angle as it will bait the dash in that direction and potentially hit others.)

Once the "inner ring" people have done their slash/dash, they will swap with the "outer ring" people. E.g. once 1/2 are hit, they swap with 5/6.

All slashes and dashes are baited and done on the inner ring.

### Nuances

- 1 and 2 happen early; it is advised for 1 (and potentially 2) to use Sprint as soon as they see their number.
- If someone dies before their number resolves, their slash / dash is targeted on a random player.
- Cruise Chaser will always spawn behind a player, so odds should be careful to avoid turning around as this could cause Cruise Chaser to - spawn facing the group.
- The 5th explosion is in the center, so be very careful you don't keep moving forward and walk into the next explosion. Extra caution is - advised for 3/4 and 5/6 players.
- As an "outer ring" player (56/78), don't be too far forward; try and be perpendicular to the inner ring player (or you might risk getting hit with their cleave)

### Healing ü©π

Astrologian is great here because of their instant-cast GCD heal, **Aspected Benefic**. If you're pro enough you can use **Aspected Benefic** on party members who have gotten hit. If you're odd, don't do this during your number otherwise you might bait CC into spawning in a weird position and then you wipe the party. üíÄ

Brute Justice casts J Kick soon after the last number resolve. It deals high damage, so try to have big burst heals + optional mitigation available asap. Things will be really rough if one healer is in 7/8 (or heavens forbid both healers are 7 and 8).
