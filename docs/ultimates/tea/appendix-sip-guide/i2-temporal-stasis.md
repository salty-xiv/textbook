# I2 Temporal Stasis

Temporal Stasis Toolbox: [Link](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=860745463802461&preview=1)

## 2m Buff Windows

None.

## Pot Windows

- #2 During the timestop. (You can do it when Alexander flutters his wings.)

## Explanation

Alexander will spawn North, and Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser will spawn east and west (they can switch positions). Neither of them are targetable yet.

- Alexander will put debuffs on 6 players, and then freeze time.
- Brute Justice will cast Flarethrower on the closest 2 players.
- Cruise Chaser will cast Alpha Sword (the big cleave from Limit Cut) on the closest 3 players.

Players must stand in positions to correctly bait these cleaves so they don't hit anyone else.

Debuffs

- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/AggravatedAssault.png" width="20px"> Aggravated Assault (1x TH, 1x DPS) - You will take damage and receive vuln debuffs. If you take any extra damage, you will die.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> Restraining Order (1x TH, 1x DPS) - A blue tether between two players. If they are not far enough apart, they will die. (If a person with this tether dies, the other person will die too.)
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/HouseArrest.png" width="20px"> House Arrest (1x TH, 1x DPS) - A green and red (Christmas) tether between two players. If they are not very close together, they will die. (If a person with this tether dies, the other person will die too.)
- No debuff (1x TH, 1x DPS) - no debuff.

Resolution

- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/HouseArrest.png" width="20px"> Christmas right / east boss. Nothing left / west boss. üõ° ü©π T/H North of boss. ‚öîÔ∏èüèπüßô DPS South of boss.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> T/H west, DPS east. Person on Cruise Chaser's side should be closer (like on the marker) - not at the wall.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/AggravatedAssault.png" width="20px"> At the wall on Brute Justice's side.

## tl;dr

- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/AggravatedAssault.png" width="20px"> Go to the wall on Brute Justice's side
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> T/H West, DPS East. Whoever is on Cruise side, stand on the marker. Otherwise, stand at the wall.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tea/HouseArrest.png" width="20px"> Stand north and south of the east boss. T/H North, DPS South.
- üö´ Stand north and south of the west boss. T/H North, DPS South.
