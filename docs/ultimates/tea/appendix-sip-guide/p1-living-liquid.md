# P1. Living Liquid

P1 Toolbox: [Link](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=830419115443951&preview=1)

Remember that Protean Waves are baited by proximity, so stand close to the source in order to bait them. On the contrary, move away / max melee to avoid being hit.

## 2m Buff Windows

- #1 At the start.

## Pot Windows

- #1 At the start.

## Invulns

MT invulns the double buster after the first Cascade.

OT invuln is not required here, but the two spots you can choose to invuln are:

- OT invulns the double buster during doll feeds (provokes LL, then shirks LL back to MT)
- OT invulns Splashes + Drainage tether

## Protean Wave 2

### DPS 🧙⚔️🏹

After taking your first hit, it's recommended that you use your **Second Wind** while moving out to take your second hit.

### Tank 🛡

OT can use **Rampart** and their short CD here to help mitigate damage from 2x Protean Waves as well as auto attacks from the hand.

### Healers 🩹

Regen and Shield Healers should ensure that the two Melees and the OT get healed after their first hit, or else they will die during their second hit.

- WHM: Benison, Tetra
- SCH: Lustrate, Excog
- AST: Celestial Intersection, ED
- SGE: i dunno lol

### Ranged 🧙🏹🩹

During Protean Wave 2, it isn't necessary to move out all the way to the wall (this increases the distance you must walk). A good distance is shown in the image below :3 Just be sure that you don't move in

## Hand of Pain

The bosses must be kept within ~5% HP of each other or it will wipe.

Hand of Pain is cast 4 times within the phase, but a competent group can skip the fight before the 4th one happens.
After the third Hand of Pain is cast (during Protean Wave 2), all players (save for the OT) should begin attacking Living Liquid to burn it down.

It's possible to manage the HP so that LL is exactly 4% below LH at the end of the cast.

### Melees ⚔️

Melees will be hitting LL most of the time. 60s cooldowns (e.g. Mug) can be used on either boss - check the HP difference first.

### Ranged 🧙🏹🩹

Ranged and Healers will be hitting Hand most of the time.

### Tanks 🛡

Tanks will be hitting their respective boss.
