## 2m Buff Windows

- #4 After Inception Formation.
- #5 During J Waves.

## Pot Windows

#2 During the timestop (Temporal Stasis).

## Invulns

Both MT and OT invulns will be used on the Chastening Heat + 3x Divine Spear combos.

It's up to the tanks to determine who will invuln first. Usually MT will invuln first and OT will invuln second.

## Inception Formation

Inception is a mechanic that has two "sections".

Alexander will spawn either North or South. Treat Alex as North for the first section.

1. Placing Judgment Crystals and popping Plasmaspheres (orbs) and baiting Flarethrowers.
2. Debuffs assigned to players, baiting 3x Alpha Sword cleaves and 1x Super Jump

### Crystals + Orbs

Crystals and orbs are assigned at random, so just be prepared to do either.

## Orb players

- Orbs will spawn on the east/west sides.
- Orbs must be popped by the player they are tethered to, otherwise the party will wipe.
- Players tethered should go stand on the red dot on the stage, opposite of their tether.
- Start near Alex, then after Alex "thumps" his feet, move down to your red dot.
- When your orb pops, move quickly towards Alex at North to avoid taking too much proximity damage from the crystal explosions.
- Then, move towards BJ side in the intercardinal, at the edge (or you might get clipped by 2nd Flarethrower).

## Crystal players

- The 4 players who aren't tethered will get crystals spawned on them.
- Run towards the south side (where Shanoa the cat is) and stand so your crystals form a "box."
- Align yourselves to the center.
- Crystals closest to the wall: Stand in between the 1st and 2nd "rivet." You can also center your circle according to the center "red dot" on the ground.
- Crystals closer to the center: Align yourselves with the player across from you at the wall. Depending on the orb locations, you might have to overlap slightly at first - but MOVE AWAY asap.

### Examples

![sip-p3-01](/assets/images/tea/sip-p3-01.png)

![sip-p3-02](/assets/images/tea/sip-p3-02.png)

## Flamethrower

üõ°Ô∏è Tank move towards BJ quickly; pop a light mit / TBN if needed. Both tanks will have to take the first two flarethrowers and the positioning and timing is quite tight. Pop sprint if needed. MT usually takes first flarethrower.

ü©π Healer make sure everyone is healed after their orb soak / crystal place, and heal everyone up again after the 3rd Flarethrower soak by the party. A mit can be used near Alex (such as Soil / Collective).

## Debuffs

Debuffs will be assigned to DPS and a Tank (if a person is dead the debuffs can get messed up):

- 1x DPS and 1x Tank will be assigned <img src="/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> Restraining Order and be tethered to each other
- 1x DPS will be assigned <img src="/assets/images/tea/SharedSentence.png" width="20px"> Shared Sentence, a 3x person stack
- 2x DPS will be assigned <img src="/assets/images/tea/AggravatedAssault.png" width="20px"> Aggravated Assault; they will take damage and must not take other damage

## True Heart

Alexander will turn invisible, but the True Heart (if awakened) will show Alexander's position when he reappears. The party will split in such a way to resolve these debuffs, as well as dodging the Sacrament cast that happens immediately when Alex reappears.

{: .important }

> When the heart moves, treat that as a relative "North". The party will split 3x West and 5x East.

### Relative West

- DPS with <img src="/assets/images/tea/SharedSentence.png" width="20px"> Shared Sentence
- 2x Tank (1x with <img src="/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> Restraining Order)
- These 3 players will stack together.

### Relative East

- 2x Healer
- 2x DPS with <img src="/assets/images/tea/AggravatedAssault.png" width="20px"> Aggravated Assault
- 1x DPS with <img src="/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> Restraining Order

Once the debuffs resolve and the Sacrament casts, everyone should quickly move towards their next positions:

## CC Cleaves

The 2x Healers ü©π and the DPS with <img src="/assets/images/tea/RestrainingOrder.png" width="20px"> Restraining Order will move around CC and be ready to bait 3x cleaves (healers will take True N/S, and the DPS will take True West). Stand close to CC as the cleaves are baited by proximity.

One of the Tanks üõ°Ô∏è (the one who invulned the first Chastening Heat usually) will move to the very True East (opposite of Brute Justice) to bait Super Jump and use a light mit / shield.

All other players will stand True East of Cruise Chaser on the 1Ô∏è‚É£ Marker. During the third cleave, move to the center to safely avoid Super Jump's radius.

## Wormhole Formation

Wormhole Formation Toolbox: [Link](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=236244852760461&preview=1)

Wormhole Formation is widely considered to be the hardest mechanic of the fight (and to some, in the whole game). It combines multiple different mechanics and, quite literally, mashes them together in what you could call an amalgamation of mechanics. As written in Eiryla‚Äôs TEA guide, Wormhole Formation is the ‚Äúpure definition of mechanic vomit, is very nuanced in movement, and requires understanding of the mechanic by all eight players.‚Äù _sheeeeeeesh_

A list of all mechanics that are involved in Wormhole:

- Baiting and avoiding Steam Chakrams from Link-up (Brute Justice)
- Resolving Limit Cut Numbers (Cruise Chaser)
- Soaking 3 sets of 2 Void of Repentance puddles (Alexander Prime)
- Baiting Super Jump (Brute Justice)
- Baiting and avoiding Apocalyptic Ray (Brute Justice)
- Avoiding Sacrament (Alexander Prime)
- Heavy stack damage from Incinerating Heat (Alexander Prime)
- Resolving Enumerations from Missile Command (Brute Justice)

There‚Äôs definitely a lot going on, but most of this mechanic‚Äôs difficulty lies in finding a solution to resolve it all. There are strats that significantly simplify the mechanic, so that the only barriers remaining are player execution and building consistency.

Of course, Wormhole Formation is about 8 minutes into the fight. In order to reliably prog, ensure that you and your group are consistent enough to reach this point of the encounter.

## Enumerations

These Enumerations are easier to execute, as tanks can be in them as well (unlike BJCC, where they must resolve the Ice Missile / Hidden Mines). You can have the 2 DPS with Enumerations stand left and right. The 2 tanks can go in the left Enumeration, and the 2 healers can go in the right Enumeration (all facing Alexander). The 2 DPS without Enumerations just remain out

## Post-Wormhole

After Wormhole, Alexander Prime will reappear and cast Mega Holy twice in succession. These hit extremely hard, so make sure the party mitigates as necessary, and the healers be vigilant with heals and shields. Ideally you should have two 10% mitigations plus shields. Don‚Äôt burn every single one of your mitigations here - lots of mitigation will be needed later.

After a few more seconds, he will begin Summoning Alexander. (imagine fighting Alexander inside Alexander while he‚Äôs summoning Alexander)

## Jwaves

For the most part, it‚Äôs as simple as killing Cruise Chaser first, then Brute Justice, then finally Alexander. However, this phase puts heavy strain on healers, so it‚Äôs important to help them out as much as possible by using a pre-planned set of staggered mitigations.

Make sure everyone is healed to full for the initial hit (J Storm). Stand slightly south of the center and stay stacked as much as possible.he first few hits of J Wave are not that hard hitting, so you can save mitigations. However, after a couple of hits, the party should begin using their mitigations at staggered times. Remember that mitigations last for several seconds, so they can catch multiple hits of J Wave.

#### Here are some mitigations / extra healing abilities you can use:

##### DPS

- Addle / Feint: 10s (3 hits)
- Troubadour / Shield Samba / Tactician: 15s (4-5 hits)

##### Tanks

- Reprisal: 10s (3 hits)
- Heart of Light / Dark Missionary: 15s (4-5 hits)
- WAR: Shake It Off: extra shielding
- PLD: Passage of Arms: 5s (1-2 hits)
- PLD: Divine Veil: extra shielding

##### WHM

- Temperance: 20s (6 hits)
- Asylum: 24s (8 hits)
- Plenary Indulgence: 10s (3 hits)
- Assize

##### SCH

- Fey / Seraphic Illumination: 20s (6 hits)
- Sacred Soil: 15s (4-5 hits)
- Whispering Dawn / Angel‚Äôs Whisper
- Fey Blessing
- Summon Seraph / Consolation
- Crit Adloquium + Deployment Tactics

##### AST

- Neutral Sect: 20s (6 hits)
- Collective Unconscious: 5s (1-2 hits)
- Horoscope
- Earthly Star
- Minor Arcana - Lady of Crowns
- Celestial Opposition

##### SGE

- I dunno this job, sorry. ;w;

Plan out with your party when to use mitigations (at how many stacks should someone use a mitigation ability?). You shouldn‚Äôt use them all at once. Ideally you want to kill Brute Justice when at around 12 stacks. If DPS is lower and Brute Justice starts gaining even more stacks, the healers may be overwhelmed with incoming damage.

It‚Äôs possible to cleave both bosses with certain skills and abilities, but it may put you out of range of heals. Have a heal ready for yourself, or at least make sure your healers are aware to give you extra heals if needed.

Some groups use their 2m cooldowns during this phase. Coordinate with your group to see what would work best.

Once you kill Cruise Chaser, move on to Brute Justice. Once you kill Brute Justice, move on to Alexander. If you see the funny dialogue text pop up (Executing judgment protocol in 10 seconds‚Ä¶), Make sure everyone is healed to full and topped off with shields, and then‚Ä¶

> Make sure to pop that Tank LB3 when the countdown reaches 4 (or 3) seconds.
