# P4. Perfect Alexander

Perfect Alexander Toolbox: [Link](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=615143888355361&preview=1)

We have three 2 minute buff windows, and 2 pot opportunities. For efficiency, we hold the final 2 minute buff window until the pot comes up.

## Pots

1. Very start, as soon as you regain control of your character
2. Off cooldown, after the last set of tankbusters.

## Buffs

1. Very start OR after Final Word (depending on P3 killtime / whether people have buffs available or not)
2. Off cooldown, should be after first set of tankbusters or during Fate Calibration α if it was delayed
3. Hold until pot comes back up (after last set of tankbusters)

## Fate

## 🛡️ Tankbusters

In Phase 4 the tankbusters consist of two abilities:

- Ordained Capital Punishment - targets the main threat. After a 3 second delay, three shared TB explosions will hit the target. (changing Main Threat can change the target, so don't provoke too early)
- Ordained Punishment - targets the main threat. Deals a hard-hitting TB on the target and inflicts a vuln. It also has a small circle AOE so tanks can't be near each other. This forces a tankswap.

There are three sets of tankbusters. The first is after Fate Calibration α, the second is after Fate Calibration β, and the last is after the first Irresistible Grace.

Usually the way to deal with this is Shared > MT > OT.

1. OT and MT share the triple hit. MT provokes after the third hit (separate from each other). Kitchen sink this - use all your mits.
2. MT invuln. OT provokes after the third hit (stay apart).
3. OT invuln. MT provokes after the third hit (stay apart).

When swapping, don't Provoke too early / too late. Also, turn stance off + shirk just in case.

## 🩹 Healing info

There's not a lot of strict healing requirements in this phase, but there are times where quick heals are needed.

- First Optical Sight (stack / spread): It can be beneficial to pop Temperance / Neutral / Illumination here. Save an Afflatus / Celestial Opposition / Fey Blessing after the first hit.
- During the shared TB - make sure the tanks stay healthy. Ensure that the tank taking the big hit is healed up to full (should be OT).
- Fate Calibration β: After the <img src="/assets/images/tea/SharedSentence.png" width="20px"> Shared Sentence and J Jump baits resolve, you'll need to quickly top everyone up (especially in the case for spreads). Things like Fey Blessing / Plenary + Afflatus Rapture / Earthly Star are useful here. Be prepared to use Tetra / Essential Dignity / Lustrate for people far away who might've missed heals.

## Almighty Judgment and Irresistible Grace

The 3-1 dodge mechanic is here and we all have to move together because there's a HUGE stack that follows immediately after. It happens twice, and it deals a lot of damage so here's what we should use for each stack:

1st stack:

- Reprisal + Dark Missionary
- Neutral Sect shields / WHM: nothing lmao
- Sacred Soil + Shields + Fey / Seraphic Illumination + Consolation Shields (if Seraph is available)
- Addle
- Feint

2nd stack:

- Reprisal + Heart of Light
- Collective Unconscious / :WHM: : Temperance
- Sacred Soil + Recitation Crit Spreadlo
- Addle or Feint
- Shield Samba

Watch Valith's guide and understand each mechanic. Some few things are done differently (like initial final word) so just understand the mech instead of the strat :)
