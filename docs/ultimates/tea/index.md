## Tips for Stillness

- PA casts Final Word
  - This gives players the light/dark debuff
  - Arrow on debuff means "not beacon"
  - Light beacon go north
  - Dark beacon go south
  - Rest between 3/C
- after 1 gcd or with 7secs left on the debuff, stillness or motion is casted
- double esc to stop targeting/auto attacks right away
