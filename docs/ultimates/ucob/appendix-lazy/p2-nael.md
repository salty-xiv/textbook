## Fire and Ice

In this phase, there are two debuffs that work with / against each other.

- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/icebitten.png" width="20px"> Icebitten means if you take another Ice attack, you will die. It can be removed by getting hit by a Fire attack.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/firescorched.png" width="20px"> Firescorched means if you take another Fire attack, you will die. It can be removed by getting hit by an Ice attack.

{: .warning }

> tl;dr double ice = die. double fire = die.

Throughout the phase, Iceclaw will pelt each player with Iceball, which gives the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/icebitten.png" width="20px"> Icebitten debuff. It will attack each player in a certain order, but the order will be messed up if there are any deaths!

Four times during the phase, Firehorn will tether a random player for a Fireball stack. Anyone in this stack will be given <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/firescorched.png" width="20px"> Firescorched.

### The Fire tethers should be resolved as follows:

1. In. Tether in the party. Everyone should stack.
2. Out. Tether away from the party. If any players have <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/icebitten.png" width="15px"> Icebitten, they should be in this stack too.
3. In. Tether in the party. The player who had the 2nd fire tether should not be in the stack.
4. In. Tether in the party. All players should be in the stack.

Of course, be cognizant of your debuff and be in/out of the stack if your debuff calls for it.

### Thunder

- Throughout the phase, Thunderwing will give the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/thunderstruck.png" width="20px"> Thunderstruck debuff on two players, which lasts 4.5 seconds.
- When the debuff expires, the players will emit a small AOE, dealing high damage and a very long Paralysis debuff to other players hit.
- If a player has Thunder, they should get away from the party as soon as possible.

### Doom

- Certain players will be inflicted with <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/doom.png" width="20px"> Doom, with specific durations (6s / 10s/ 16s).
- At the same time, random players will be targeted for Wings of Salvation which is a white puddle AOE that explodes and deals lethal damage after a few seconds.
- Afterwards, it leaves behind a smaller white circle, which is used to cleanse a doom.
- <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/doom.png" width="20px"> Doomed players are supposed to cleanse their doom with the puddle that corresponds to their debuff length (6s takes 1st puddle, 10s takes 2nd puddle, 16s takes 3rd puddle).
- Non-doomed players can pick up the puddle so watch out!

For the best puddle placement, the party should be tightly stacked together and rotate clockwise as a group. If you have <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ucob/thunderstruck.png" width="20px"> Thunderstruck, rotate CCW / away instead.

### Divebombs

Three random players in sequence will get a green/black Divebomb marker above their head. When it disappears, it snapshots a location of where dragons will dive (Cauterize).

- The 1st divebomb marker will mark the dive location for the first two dragons (starting from N and going clockwise).
- The 2nd divebomb marker is for the third dragon, and;
- The 3rd divebomb marker is for the fourth and fifth dragons.
- (2 - 1 - 2)

Additionally, Nael will pelt the 1st and 2nd divebomb players with Hypernova puddles. Standing in these puddles will give you a lethal bleed tick.

Bait these puddles by going to your bait location and then rotate CW along the wall, then safely go back to the group.

#### To determine divebomb locations:

Usually, the A-B-C markers are fine (1st divebomb bait at A, 2nd divebomb bait at B, etc).

However, in some cases, the location of the dragons will not allow for this solution. This is a "use your eyes" moment :'3 good luck and try to create a solution!
