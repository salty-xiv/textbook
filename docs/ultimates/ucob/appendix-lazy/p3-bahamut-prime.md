# P3 Bahamut Prime

Use a Tank LB when you get knocked back. You need at least an LB2 with lots of healing. LB3 is comfy but healers should still heal.

Bahamut Prime's phase involves different "parts": the active phases where you can deal damage with minimal mechanics (TBs and raidwides), and downtime mechanics called Trios.
This is similar to TEA's Alexander Prime phase (Inception / Wormhole formation) and UWU's Ultima phase (Ultimate Predation / Suppression).

## Bahamut's abilities are as follows:

- **Flare Breath**: TB cone in front of Bahamut. No castbar.
- **Flatten**: Castbar TB dealing physical damage. Feint is useful. Must be mitigated.
- **Earthshaker**: Gives certain players a marker over their head. Marked players will be hit with a 90 degree cone from Bahamut towards their position. Overlapping causes death. Will leave behind an Earth puddle which gives a lethal dot tick if stood in.
- **Megaflare (mark)**: A circle will appear around 3 / 4 players. These players must stack together as one of these players will be hit with stack damage.
- **Megaflare (pizza)**: An AOE puddle will appear underneath players. Dodge out of these, as they will explode afterwards.
- **Megaflare (spread)**: Random players will be hit with an AOE, so players should be spread out.
- **Gigaflare**: Heavy magical raidwide, should have Reprisal + Party mit + shields.

## Bahamut Prime Trio Toolboxes

- Here are toolboxes made by yours truly :3
- I'll update this message when I complete everything
- Read the notes!!

### Quickmarch Trio:

[toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=555978717260761&preview=1)

- A simple mechanic. Split up into L and R groups. Move in after dive to avoid twisters.
- DPS with Megaflare go to south to stack. DPS with Earthshaker go N.
- Healers stay E / W. Tanks pick up tethers and go E / W.
- Stay out of puddles. Everyone return to S except main threat.

### Blackfire Trio:

[toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=665978784660761&preview=1)

- Start in center. Bait 5x Liquid Hells while moving to Nael. DPS rotate CCW, Supports rotate CW.
- Players with Megaflare move to stack opposite of Nael. Non-marked players get towers (ranged far).
- Tower players move in to tower after 2nd Hypernova. Don't stand in Hypernovas.

### Fellruin Trio:

[toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=865979231760761&preview=1)

- In -> Spread or Spread -> In. Party takes Neurolink opposite of Bahamut, tanks take neurolinks L/R of Bahamut.
- After raidwide, stay spread to avoid clipping others with Meteor Stream.

### Heavensfall Trio:

[toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=795971593270761&preview=1)

- Check boss locations and dive pattern. If Nael is center, dives are "X" pattern. Move in after dive to avoid twisters.
- Check towers. Tower under Nael = R1. Right group go CW, Left group go CCW.
- Get knocked back into towers. Dodge pizza slices, starting from outside and running in to center.
- Stack for Fireball and heal for Gigaflare.

### Tenstrike Trio:

[toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=526970087080761&preview=1)

- 3 players get marked with Hatch. After they pop their orb, they will get marked again but 3 players have to intercept their Hatch.
- Everyone has to stay spread to avoid clipping others with continuous Meteor Streams on everyone.
- Then, 2 sets of Earthshakers on 4 players each. Players with 1st set of Earthshakers use eyes / adjust, and aim W, SW, SE, E. Make 1 the safe spot.
- Players with 2nd set of Earthshakers can use the corners of 1 marker to preposition spots while 1st set goes off. Then exchange places.

### Grand Octet:

Toolbox probably not needed. But will make probably / upon request.

- Start in the middle. Look for Bahamut. If Bahamut is on Cardinal = CCW. If Bahamut is on Intercardinal = CW.
- Look opposite of Bahamut. Once the first divebomb marker appears, we run there. Adjust 1 CCW/CW if Nael is directly opposite of Bahamut.
- Keep track of if you get a divebomb marker (including red)! Sprint / start running inwards.
- If you never got a divebomb marker you will be in charge of baiting Twintania.
- 4 players will get marked with Megaflare. They stack to the right of Twintania.
- 4 players will take a tower. The one baiting Twintania might have to take a tower OR go in the Megaflare stack. So if Twintania baiter doesn't have Megaflare, leave the closest tower to Twintania open for them.
- Twintania's dive location will be snapshotted WHEN their divebomb marker appears, so once you see it above your head you can move to the megaflare stack/tower.
- Once towers / Twintania's dive resolves, there will be a Twister. Run around in circles in your Tower to avoid popping Twisters.

{: .warning }

> Alternatively you can Tank LB3 and have everyone just spread out / one person in a tower.

{: .note }

> Prepare Arm's Length / Surecast just in case Twintania wasn't baited correctly.
