# Adds

## Tank stuff

It's really really important that you use your mitigations according to the timings in this document: [googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rcESgI8n_wiL9L42FzmUQvVOg9zlO_pSfo5R8sAn2LU/edit?usp=sharing)

Usually, MT (WAR in the document) will have threat at the end of Bahamut (P3). This means that when we start adds phase (P4) your rampart will not be up. At the start of Adds, OT (GNB in the document) should take/provoke Nael and MT should take/provoke Twin; this is because Twin's tankbuster (Plummet) doesn't hurt as much as Nael's tankbuster (Bahamut's Claw). Again, refer to the mit timeline above to plan.

## Adds Mechanics

Unlike in Clees' guide, we will have our tanks **tank the bosses Northeast** (between the A and D markers). Ensure that you aren't standing on top of each other in order to avoid having Plummet overlap. (Think of handling LL and Hand's split TB while they are stacked together)

The adds phase is a culmination of Twintania and Nael deus Darnus mechanics. The tanks will be taking LOTS of damage here so healers should be paying attention to their HP and GCD whenever needed.

The tankbusters involved are Plummet from Twintania, and Bahamut's Claw from Nael. Point Twin away from the other tank.

There are also tankswap busters, which will force a tankswap (Death Sentence from Twintania, Ravensbeak from Nael).

- Tankbusters, as described above
- Tankswaps, as described above
- 3x Generate (Hatches from Twintania)
- Twister (from Twintania)
- Random Nael triple quote (from Nael)
- Liquid Hell (from Twintania)
- Megaflare (Raidwide from Nael)

## Important points

- Bosses must be killed at roughly the same time. Otherwise, a VERY FAST ENRAGE will begin casting once one is killed.
- Caster LB can be used nearing the end of the phase to finish off the two.

## Hatches in Adds

Hatches works slightly differently in adds, as one of the hatches will take longer to get to its neurolink than the other two (because of the bosses positioning).

Because the bosses are positioned NE, here is how to assign and resolve hatches:

- 1 Hatch (Close, left side): L3 (Left Melee)
- 3 Hatch (Close, right side) R3 (Right Melee)
- 2 Hatch (Far): Phys ranged
- Flexer: Caster / other ranged

Melees + physranged will go to their assigned hatch if they get it. The flexer, if they get it, will be responsible of going to the needed neurolink.

Please look at my cute little diagram :)

### Twisters during Hatch

Since we have two "close" neurolinks and one "far" neurolink, we resolve the simultaneous Twisters as such:

- Close neurolinks: Resolve hatches first → Dodge twister
- Far neurolink Bait twister out of neurolink first → Resolve hatch

Flexer will have to know both timings based on the neurolink, but everyone should know this as a rule.

## Quotes in Adds

After each Generate + Twister, Nael will do a triple quote. There are only four combinations, but here they are regardless:

> _From hallowed moon I descend, upon burning earth to tread!_
>
> In → Out → Stack

> _From hallowed moon I bare iron, in my descent to wield!_
>
> In → Out → Dive

> _Unbending iron, descend with fiery edge!_
>
> Out → Dive → Stack

> _Unbending iron, take fire and descend!_
>
> Out → Stack → Dive

After the last part of each quote, there will be a twister. Spread in different directions.

Here are my rules (PLEASE READ)

- Dive is a light spread. Don't be too close to others or players might get sent into the wall.
- Stack will ALWAYS be resolved in the center of the stage.
- After the third part of the quote, there will be a TWISTER - AVOID PLS ; ^ ;

## General Timeline

- Tankbusters (Plummet + Bahamut's Claw)
- 5x Liquid Hells (baited by physical ranged)
- Generate (3x DPS)
- Twister (bait Twister correctly if you have far Hatch)
- Nael Triple Quote
- Twister
- Megaflare (Raidwide)
- Tankswaps (Death Sentence + Ravensbeak)

After the tankswaps, the mechanics repeat - thus having a second "cycle" of the timeline above.

However, in the second cycle, the Tankswaps occur before the Megaflare raidwide.

## Enrage Casts

- White Fury - 3 second enrage, casted by Nael if Twintania is killed first
- Twin Fury - 3 second enrage, casted by Twintania if Nael is killed first

KILL THEM AT THE SAME TIME, use caster LB if needed!!
