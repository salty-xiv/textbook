# Golden Bahamut

## Golden Bahamut Mechanics

There's only three.

- Morn Afah - Extremely hard hitting party stack on a random player. At least 30% + Shields needed.
- Akh Morn - Big shared tankbuster, starting at 3 hits and increasing by 1 hit every cast.
- Exaflare - Spawns AOE circles that traverse the arena in a specific direction. There will be 3 sets of two for each cast. These deal lethal damage + Damage Down if you happen to survive (tanks). The AOEs during the middle of the castbar and can spawn from any cardinal or intercardinal.

## Stack Mitigation

There are 5x Morn Afah stacks, and each one should be mitigated appropriately.

There is at least 30s between each Morn Afah, so we should have Soil / Kerachole on all of them.

Morn Afah 1:

- Tank: MT Reprisal + 90s Mit
- Shield Healer: Shields + Soil / Kerachole
- AST: Collective Unconscious
- Ranged DPS: Troubadour / Tactician / Shield Samba

Morn Afah 2:

- Tank: OT Reprisal + 90s
- Shield Healer: Shields + Soil / Kerachole
- Melee DPS: Feint (M1)
- Caster DPS: Addle

Morn Afah 3:

- Tank: MT Reprisal + 90s Mit
- Shield Healer: Shields + Soil / Kerachole + Fey Illumination (or save for 5)
- AST: Collective Unconscious
- Melee DPS: Feint (M2)

Morn Afah 4:

- Tank: OT Reprisal + 90s
- Shield Healer: Shields + Soil / Kerachole
- Ranged DPS: Troubadour / Tactician / Shield Samba

Morn Afah 5:

- Tank: MT Reprisal + 90s Mit
- Shield Healer: Shields + Soil / Kerachole + Fey Illumination if needed
- AST: Collective Unconscious
- Melee DPS: Feint (M1)
- Caster DPS: Addle

### Non double melee setups:

Double caster:

- Caster DPS: Caster A: 1st / 3rd (+ 5th) (Early Addle for 1st)
- Caster DPS: Caster B: 2nd (+ 5th)

Double phys ranged:

- Ranged DPS: Ranged A: 1st / 4th
- Ranged DPS: Ranged B: 2nd / 5th

## Enmity

Have the MT start (or tank with shorter invuln cooldown) the boss. Swap when invulning Akh Morns.

## Tankbuster Handling

There are 4x Akh Morns.

Akh Morn 1 (3 hits)

- Stack together + kitchen sink

Akh Morn 2 (4 hits)

- MT Invuln

Akh Morn 3 (5 hits)

- OT Invuln

Akh Morn (6 hits)

- Stack together + kitchen sink

## General Rules

- When it is Morn Afah → Akh Morn (stack → TB), tanks will move away, party stay.
- When it is Akh Morn → Morn Afah (TB → Stack), tanks will come to party.

tl;dr tank moves to party / away from party.

e.g. When starting the phase, party will be South of Bahamut for Morn Afah. Afterwards, tanks will move away to North to take their shared Akh Morn tankbuster.

Spread out during Enrage to squeeze out as much damage as possible, as Bahamut will blast every party member with a Morn Afah.
