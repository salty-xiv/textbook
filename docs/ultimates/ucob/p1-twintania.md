# P1 Twintania 🐉

## Summery

Main mechanics of this phase is:

- When Twintania hits certain health thresholds (74%, 44%, 0%), they drop a neurolinks puddle. These puddles need to be placed properly for later phases
- All players will periodic have to bait twisters without running into another players twister
- Tanks are moving the boss for puddle placement and dealing with tank busters with required swap
- Non-Tanks are dealing with baiting orbs onto neurolinks puddles (random non-tank)
- 1-2 Ranged players will be baiting liquid hell puddles (farthest player)

## Tips for Twisters

> don't die to twisters 👍

Snapshot of twister is towards the end of the cast bar. make sure to move further after the cast bar ends. TODO add an example

## 100% to 74%
